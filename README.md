## üí° Learnings

- Had little to no knowledge of ML before the Microsoft Engage Program's qualification announcement. It took over a week to understand the fundamentals, and grasp an idea for integration with a web application.
- Obtained working knowledge of PHP over the course of a few days, and began to code alongside the learning process.
- Started out with MySQL and PHP, and switched over to PostgreSQL in the last week as I needed to use Heroku Postgres for deployment. This required quite a few changes to the codebase. 
- Deployed a full stack app with frontend, backend and database for the first time. Documentations and tutorials came to the rescue.
